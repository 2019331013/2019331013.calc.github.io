I've made this calculator as my first project after starting to learn JavaScript.   

At first it was just a normal calculator. But as we know, when we get used to a calculator, we start to calculate simple calculation like 12+7, 43-39, 230*10, 12000/100 etc.
So I've build a function `veryEasy` to figure out those easy calculation and give an alternative text in stead of giving the calculation result to make people calcualte these easy 
calculation by their own.     

Though my `veryEasy` funtion is just a prototype and it can figure out a few combination for each operator. It's just a start.
